# Competitive Programming

Although one does not require much background mathematical knowledge in order to be able to participate in Competitive Programming as well as Computing Challenges, it is certainly a benefit to have some ability in this field. This repository is more of a record for myself where I develop, implement, research and document techniques as well as algorithms which have been optimised for efficiency whilst trying my best to not use many libraries, however, it may be necessary to use some libraries for some greater ease and be able to test out a few solutions.
