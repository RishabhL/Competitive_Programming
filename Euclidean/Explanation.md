# What is the Euclidean Algorithm used for?

The Euclidean Algorithm is and efficient method used to work out the GCD and LCM of 2 integers. The GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) of two or more numbers is the largest number that divides into each of the numbers with no remainder. The LCM(Lowest Common Multiple) of two or more numbers is the smallest positive integer that is evenly divisible by both numbers.
